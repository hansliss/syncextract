# syncextract
Extract files from a Synclavier floppy image.

This is based on a very quick reverse-engineer effort to figure out the directory format.
The results look reasonable, but further work may be needed. There may be some use for additional
options as well, like file listing without extraction and whatnot, but my own needs are simple.
